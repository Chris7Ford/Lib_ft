# Libft

### Purpose
Libft is the first project you have to complete as a student at 42.  In this project, we had to rewrite many of the standard library functions, as well as some that are not included in any libraries for our future use.

This is the library that I have used in all of my following projects.  Because they have been used into the future, it is important that they are airtight and work like they should, as they are very often building blocks for my other functions. Each time I write a new function that I think might come in handy later, I add it to my libft repository.  Its a constant work in progress.


### Usage
There is a *Makefile* included with this repository, so just navigate to the repository's directory and type:

`make`

This will generate a `libft.a` file, which is to be used to compile with your program.



Want to know more about this project?

Feel free to read the included PDF instructions.  Not all of the functions in the repository are included in the PDF though, because some of them are mine.

#### But why would you rewrite standard library functions?

The point of the assignment is to make it yourself.  One of my favorite parts of 42 is that you make everything from scratch, and it helps the students learn the necessary skills to become good at building things.
